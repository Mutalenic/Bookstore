## Bookstore: Styling
In this project, I have connected my React-Redux application to an existing API to create and remove books in a remote server by doing the following:
- Used store, actions and reducers in React.
- Connect React and Redux.
- Connected an existing API via Redux and used the data to display the books.
- Applied React best practices and language style guides in code.
